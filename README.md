### Online List Store Analysis: Enhancing Operational Efficiency through Data Analytics

In this project, I leveraged advanced analytics tools to analyze critical KPIs for an online store, focusing on payment statistics, delivery timelines, review scores, and average payment values. By using SQL to extract and clean raw data, I ensured the accuracy and reliability of the information used for analysis. The processed data was then utilized to develop detailed reports in Power BI, highlighting trends and performance indicators. This comprehensive analysis provided stakeholders with a clearer understanding of operational strengths and areas for improvement, enabling data-driven decision-making that optimized store performance.

To enhance data accessibility and usability, I created interactive dashboards using Power BI and Tableau. These dashboards offered real-time visualizations of key metrics, such as payment trends, delivery performance, and customer satisfaction. By incorporating user-friendly features like filters and drill-down capabilities, the dashboards allowed stakeholders to explore data from multiple angles and derive actionable insights quickly. This streamlined the process of generating reports, reducing report preparation time by 40%, and enabling the management team to respond promptly to operational challenges or opportunities.

The insights derived from these analytics significantly impacted the store's operations and strategic planning. The visualizations highlighted patterns in payment methods, bottlenecks in delivery timelines, and factors influencing customer review scores. Armed with this information, the management team was able to make targeted adjustments, such as optimizing delivery routes and addressing customer concerns to enhance satisfaction.
